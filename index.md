  content: <h2>SIP Helps Vulnerable Populations in Philadelphia and Beyond Secure
    and Protect Their Most Valuable Assets</h2><p>Vulnerable populations are often
    subject to living in unsatisfactory conditions. For many reasons, critical documents,
    valuable possessions, and family heirlooms can be easily lost, destroyed, or stolen.
    SIP seeks to protect people who are just getting on their feet in the city - or
    the country - from fraud, theft, violence, or intimidation by helping them understand
    the value of their documentation and secure their personal information. Our programs
    and services are provided at no cost to ensure the lowest possible barrier to
    inclusion.</p><p><a href="/programs/" title="View Our Programs" target="_blank">View
